## Hey there! 👋 

I'm an italian PI-shaped developer.

Developing since I was 11 years old I used to growing up with technology. When I'm not typing on my keyboards for some projects I like to watch movies/tv shows/anime, to hit the gym, to think about the next destination for a travel and to ride my motorbike.
